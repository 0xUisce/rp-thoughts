This vote aims to align RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.

### Summary
- RPL rewards will scale differently, with a focus on aligning RPL rewards with supplying rETH
- It will be possible to withdraw down to 15% borrowed ETH
- We will ramp to both of the above states
- Withdrawing will be a 2-step process where RPL is set to "withdrawing" for 28 days before it can
  be withdrawn

### Rationale
The main goal is to align the DAO's spending on RPL rewards with the DAO's goals. In particular, we'll continue to send 70% of inflation to Node Operators, but align it far more with amount of minted rETH.

_Please_ read the Intro document's [context section](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/tree/main/rpl_staking) for a visual representation of spending before and after this change. 

### Detailed Outcomes
- RPL rewards will scale differently
  - Adding a minipool will increase RPL rewards (even if you already had enough staked RPL)
  - Converting an EB16 to two LEB8s will increase rewards (even if you already had enough staked RPL)
  - You need staked RPL value of â‰¥10% borrowed ETH to get RPL rewards [unchanged]
  - Staking more RPL means more rewards [unchanged], though now without a maximum
  - Beyond 15% borrowed ETH, additional rewards go up slower and slower
  - The rewards changes will be phased in slowly over 6 months
- It will be possible to withdraw down to 15% borrowed ETH
- Make withdrawal a 2-step process
  - Set X RPL to "withdrawing"; these RPL are no longer eligible for rewards or voting 
  - After 28 days, the RPL may be withdrawn
  - Remove the current 28-day withdrawal lock when you stake RPL 
  - Phase in the new rules partially over time, then fully with the next smart contract release
- These changes apply equally to both existing and new NOs
